However, you are not allowed to have more than one of the same Pharaohs on your team. The opposing team, however, CAN pick the same Pharaoh that is chosen on your team. Players can earn in-game currency by completing each normal match.",

  "details2": "NFT Match is a competitive seasonal game mode that runs for a specific period of time. You will be competing with other players sharing your ranked division bracket.
